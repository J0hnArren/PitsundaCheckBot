### FAQ
1. The bot recognized the image incorrectly, why?
   The recognition accuracy is almost 99%. The reasons for the error may be as follows:
      - The photo is very blurry or fuzzy
      - The photo shows a drawing or screenshot from a cartoon with a cat or dog
      - The photo shows both a cat and a dog, or there are neither of them at all (the neural network is not designed to recognize other objects)
2. Why is the bot called Pitsunda? Because she's a cute kitty! Isn't she?
